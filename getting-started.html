        <h4>Getting Started</h4>
        <p>To enable HTTPS on your website, you need to get a certificate (a type of file) from a Certificate Authority (CA). CyberEncrypt is a CA. In order to get a certificate for your website’s domain from CyberEncrypt, you have to demonstrate control over the domain. With CyberEncrypt, you do this using software that uses the ACME protocol which typically runs on your web host.</p>

            <p>To figure out what method will work best for you, you will need to know whether you have shell access (also known as SSH access) to your web host. If you manage your website entirely through a control panel like cPanel, Plesk, or WordPress, there’s a good chance you don’t have shell access. You can ask your hosting provider to be sure.</p>

            <h4>With Shell Access</h4>
            <p></p>We recommend that most people with shell access use the Certbot ACME client. It can automate certificate issuance and installation with no downtime. It also has expert modes for people who don’t want autoconfiguration. It’s easy to use, works on many operating systems, and has great documentation. Visit the Certbot site to get customized instructions for your operating system and web server.</p>

           <p>If Certbot does not meet your needs, or you’d like to try something else, there are many more ACME clients to choose from. Once you’ve chosen ACME client software, see the documentation for that client to proceed.</p>
